## Hi there 👋

I am currently a **Ph.D. candidate** in the **Department of Computer Science** at the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC)**, working under the supervision of **Dr. Pu Wang** at the **GENIUS Lab**. My research focuses on advancing **computer vision** and **generative AI**, particularly in:

- **3D Human Pose Estimation** and **Mesh Recovery**.
- **3D Human Motion Generation** driven by multi-modal inputs (e.g., text, music, or speech), with a focus on achieving controllable, high-quality synthesis for realistic and dynamically responsive motion generation in real-time interactive settings.

### Education
Before joining UNCC, I earned my **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** from the **Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)** in August 2021. During my time at LUMS, I worked with **Dr. Fareed Zaffar** and **Dr. Agha Ali Raza** at the **Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)**.
